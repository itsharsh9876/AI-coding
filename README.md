# CodeAssist AI - Intelligent Programming Assistant

## Problem Statement
In the rapidly evolving landscape of software development, developers face several challenges:
- Navigating multiple programming languages and frameworks
- Writing boilerplate code efficiently
- Debugging complex issues
- Learning new programming concepts and best practices
- Finding language-specific solutions quickly

Traditional documentation and Stack Overflow searches can be time-consuming and may not always provide context-aware solutions. There's a need for an intelligent, interactive tool that understands multiple programming languages and can provide real-time assistance.

## Project Objective
CodeAssist AI aims to create an open-source, language-aware coding assistant that helps developers:
- Generate code snippets and solutions in their preferred programming language
- Get instant, contextual programming assistance
- Learn best practices and modern development patterns
- Debug code issues effectively
- Improve coding productivity with AI-powered suggestions

## Technical Implementation
